# Cheering-trash-can
Every time someone throws garbage in the trash can a cheering noise is played 

To encourage students at our school to throw the garbage resulting from lunch or dinner in the trash cans available in the lunch/dining area we have come up with the idea of played a popular cheering sound when something is thrown in a trash can. 
On the lid on top of the trash can we have built a soccer goal that the students can aim at. Also, we have fixed leds to the goal that will flash at the same time something is thrown into the trash can.
