# Cheering-trash-can
Every time someone throws garbage in the trash can a cheering noise is played 

To encourage students at our school to throw the garbage resulting from lunch or dinner in the trash cans available in the lunch/dining area we have come up with the idea of playing a popular cheering sound as a "reward" when they throw something in our special trash can. 
On the lid, on top of the trash can, we have mounted a soccer goal that the students can aim at. On the top bar of the goal we have fixed led lights that will flash as an extra reward when they have successfully thrown something in the trash can.
