# Cheering-trash-can
Every time someone throws garbage in the trash can a cheering noise is played 

To encourage students at our school to throw garbage resulting from lunch or dinner in the trash cans available in the lunch/dining area we have come up with the idea of playing a popular cheering sound as a "reward" when they throw something in our special trash can. 
On the lid, on top of the trash cans, we have mounted a soccer goal that the students can aim at. We have also fixed leds to the top bar of the goal that will flash as an extra reward when they successfully throw something in the trash can.
